# litegl
Litegl is a library that wraps WebGL to make it more user-friendly by creating classes for managing different items like Buffer, Mesh, Texture, Shader and other common aspects of any WebGL applications. It is a fork from Litegl.js

 * New events system extracted from myou engine (https://myou.cat) by [Alberto Torres Ruiz](https://github.com/DiThi)[Julio Manuel LÃ³pez](http://pixelements.net). 
 * Modifications to get it working as npm module.
 
Litegl.js is a fork from [LightGL.js](https://github.com/evanw/lightgl.js/) by [Evan Wallace](http://madebyevan.com), but some major changes have been made.
Some of the main differences:

 * Matrices have been replaced by glMatrix
 * Meshes are forced to be stored in ArrayBuffer formats
 * Meshes support range rendering with offset
 * Removed fixed pipeline behaviour
 * Better event handling (mouse position, mouse wheel, dragging)
 * Textures expanded to support Arraybuffers and Cubemaps
 * Events system to trigger events from any object
 * Support for multiple WebGL contexts in the same page

This library has been used in several projects like [Rendeer.js](https://github.com/jagenjo/rendeer.js) or [Canvas2DtoWebGL](https://github.com/jagenjo/Canvas2DtoWebGL).</p>


Demos

Demos are included in the Examples folder.

Usage
-----

```
npm install litegl
```

Create the context
```js
var GL = require("litegl")
var gl = GL.create({width:800, height:600});
```

Attach to DOM
```js
document.getElementById("mycontainer").appendChild( gl.canvas )
```

Compile shader
```js
var shader = new GL.Shader( vertex_shader_code, fragment_shader_code );
```

Create Mesh
```js
var mesh = new GL.Mesh({vertices:[-1,-1,0, 1,-1,0, 0,1,0], coords:[0,0, 1,0, 0.5,1]});
```

Load a texture
```js
var texture = GL.Texture.fromURL("image.jpg", { minFilter: gl.LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR });
```


Render
```js
gl.ondraw = function() {
	texture.bind(0);
	var my_uniforms = { u_texture: 0, u_color: [1,1,1,1] };
	shader.uniforms( my_uniforms ).draw( mesh );
}

gl.animate(); //calls the requestAnimFrame constantly, which will call ondraw
```
